# Training Client Table
This application simulates an environment in which fitness trainers can input data about their clients and then app can calculate body mass index, basal metabolic rate, and maintenance calorie recommendation. 

## Structure
The app is two pages with home being index.html holding our table and displayMetrics.html holding our metrics calculations. jscripts.js holds the scripts for index.html and metricScripts.js hold our scripts for displayMetrics.html. clientClass.js holds our client class as well as our initialization array. 

## Technical Display
In this project, my skills with DOM manipulation using document.querySelector and document.getElementById. An HTML table is dynamically created based on the length of our client array using a for loop. The state of the array persists in local storage and local storage is update upon user array updates. In the user input field I included input validation using if statements to ensure accurate data types and value ranges for the client object inputs. The DOM styling is also manipulated by displaying and hiding forms on button click.
